                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: So Lam Jones is a site for the bedroom musician?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: Yes, but Lam Jones also encourages people to meet in the real world when and where possible, and form bands and play live at real-life events.</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: So Lam Jones is a site for bands, too?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: Absolutely. Bands need mixers, album art, maybe even a promoter. Lam Jones is everything music driven and creator driven. If you need something in the creative realm, Lam Jones is where to find it.</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: Is Lam Jones going to rip us off like Colonel Parker ripped off Elvis?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: No! With Lam Jones, you get to keep total control over your music and you and your collaborators get to keep ownership and all revenue for all your music, FOREVER.</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: How do the musicians divide up any revenue?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: That is up to you. The rule is that the creator can create any terms they choose, and collaborators can choose to accept or not, depending on how enthusiastic they are about a project. However, here are the official Lam Jones recommendations:</p>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>Music: 15%</li>
                            <li>Lyrics: 15%</li>
                            <li>Lead Instruments including Lead Vocals: 30%</li>
                            <li>Rhythm Instruments: 20%</li>
                            <li>Peripheral Instruments including Backing Vocals: 10%</li>
                            <li>Mixer/Producer: 10%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mb-0">Percentages are divided by the number of musicians in each category. Obviously, if there are a ton of musicians in one category, these numbers would shift. As we said, it's totally up to you. We would just suggest that you acknowledge the contributions of each participant.</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: Dividing up revenue? Don't you know that there's no money in music unless you're a big company?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: Any song can catch fire on a streaming service these days. Better to have the discussion beforehand, rather than after a song goes viral...</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: Dividing up revenue? You mean contracts and lawyers?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: Hey, we're not a legal site. We just bring people together. If we get corroboration that a member is not honoring their commitments, we will ban them from the site.</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Q: What about music videos?</h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">A: Whoa, slow down cowboy. Give our developers a little time to get this site rolling. But the short answer is sure, we think that would be cool to include down the road.</p>
